React app contains props and States.
Instead of for we use htmlFor and react is case sensitive.
We can return upto one HTML element in React in this case we have div if you want to do so then you should use jsk Fragement
Here are some major changes like instead of html class we use className KeyWord as class is reserved keyword in react 
Things is written inside {} in jsx is countered as JavaScript
Not rendered as HTML for safety purpose

Props in react stands for properties
props is the parameter of the function based component
https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

Always named component with capital letter. 
Every component has it's state
State means state (condition,avastha)
We are passing the props in component but not state
we can't update state like normal variable in rjs to do that we should use updation function
Stats It must declared inside function component
useState hook is help us to create an state variables
props.alert && it means that props.alert evaluate first and if is true the rest of stuff is being evaluated
(upper syntax is not preferred by harry but preferred by the community and here alert is not the keyword it is just the value of props to be passed)

This happens because all the JSX will be converted to JavaScript calls
Button onClick event need function 'Arshil' not function call 'Arshil()' so do that in onclick we use arrow function
 - onclick(()=>{props.Arshil('Legend.')})
